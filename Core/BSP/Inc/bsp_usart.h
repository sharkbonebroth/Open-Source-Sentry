/** Instructions
 * 1) Configure USARTx and the corresponding DMA in CubeMX. Refer to instructions on GitHub.
 * 2) Include this header file.
 * 3) Start circular DMA process for detecting received data using usart_start(). Note
 *    that this function is blocking so this should be started in a freeRTOS task. Call
 *    this after all peripherals have been initialized.
 * 4) Define usart_ISR() somewhere in the code to respond to received data on USARTx.
 * 5) Whenever the DMA received data, the ISR will be triggered. To get the buffer of
 *    raw received data, use the usart_get_data() function.
 * 6) To sent data on the USARTx port, use the usart_send_data() function.
